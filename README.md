### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```properties
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_DB=musicplanet
MYSQL_USER=musicplanet
MYSQL_PASSWORD=you_db_password
PORT=8000
```
The variables are used to configure `application.properties` file.

### schema.sql

The `schema.sql` file is used to create the database schema. The file is located in the `src/main/data` directory.

Each line in the file is a SQL statement, and the file is executed when the application starts. **Don't** split the SQL statements into multiple lines.
